# Technical Tests
Technical tests uploaded here must be stripped from any information that connects them to any company or organization.  
In other words the sole reason of this repository is to present work you have implemented while job seeking since this can be useful to whoever wants to evaluate your work in the future and it is not meant to be used otherwise.  

### Conventions
In this respect, the convention is to locally move any company related information in the folder `company_info` as this folder is being ignored by git according to the configuration in .gitignore file.  
Any user who uploads his/her technical tests is free to upload his/her information so that companies would be able to get in touch with him/her in case they are impressed by his/her work. At the root folder create a folder that is unique to you and be consistent with it.

If you are a creator, happy sharing!  
If you are a company, happy exploring!
